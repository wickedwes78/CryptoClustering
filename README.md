# CryptoClustering

## Description
_Module 19 Challenge - University of Adelaide - Data Analytics BootCamp_

In this challenge I have used Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24 hour or 7 day price changes.

**Question:** What is the best value for `k`? 

**Answer:** 4 - It's where the elbow is most prominent 

**Question:** What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

**Answer:** 89.5% of the total variance is condensed into the 3 PCA variables.  

**Question:** After visually analysing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?  

**Answer:** Having fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means appears to reduce outliers and shows a refined interpretation of the cluster analysis results.
